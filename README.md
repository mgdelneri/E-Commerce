# E-Commerce

## GOAL

The goal of this project was to build the back-end for an e-commerce site by modifying started code. The npm packages used for this are: Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL2, and Dotenv. 

This functional Express.js API is meant to be able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When the server is started with Node.js, the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. Once everything is synced, the routes allows the user to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core. 

## PROCESS

My first steps, as usual, were to carefully read through the assignment instructions, take notes, and break it down into sections. This made it easier to organize all of my repo folders and files in VS Code and in Git Hub. 

I then read through the given started code, trying to understand the connections between all of the code as well as the parts that needed to be completed. 

Before starting to actually code, I studied the last unit's activities, with a focus on the mini project. I took notes on those in order to become better familiar with the syntax and logic in all of the styles of files. 

The next step was to start coding. I went from the top and started completing the necessary code, using my mini project notes as a reference. I first went through the files in the models folder. I then moved onto the files in the routes folder. The code outside of these two folders was completed for the most part, with the exception of some code that needed to be added to server.js in order to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database. 

The next step was to test the functionality of the code both in VS Code and in Insomnia Core, studying each error along the way and fixing bugs. Once the app was functioning as desired, I recorded a walk-through video showing its functionality. 

Here is a walkthrough video of E-Commerce's functionality:

## CONCLUSION

This project showed me how invaluable it is to truly study the solutions to the activities outside of class. Back-end material has really stumped me most of the time, so I took the time to take notes and really study the mini project, as well as referencing the other activities for similarities/differences. 
Because of this, it took me a lot longer to actually start coding, but once I started, my thoughts were better organized and the code flowed better. As a new coder, there is a tendency to want to go straight to coding and make apps work as fast as possible, and this was good practice in the organization that is necessary before the coding starts.
